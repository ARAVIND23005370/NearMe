        A mountain resort is a place to holiday or vacation located in an elevated and typically at least relatively isolated area. The term resort implies integral hotel or inn accommodations, restaurants, and either or both sports facilities or scenic attractions. These can either be part of a "destination resort" that provides both accommodations and activities, or in a "resort town" that offers amenities near outdoor areas.
